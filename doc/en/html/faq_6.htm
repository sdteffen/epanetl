<P>To determine the maximum pressure available at a node when the flow demanded must be increased to suppress a fire, add the fire flow to the node's normal demand, run the analysis, and note the resulting pressure at the node.</P>

<P></P>

<P>To determine the maximum flow available at a particular pressure, set the emitter coefficient at the node to a large value (e.g., 100 times the maximum flow expected) and add the required pressure head (2.3 times the pressure in psi) to the node's elevation.  After running the analysis, the available fire flow equals the actual demand reported for the node minus any consumer demand that was assigned to it.</P>
