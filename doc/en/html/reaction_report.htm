<P>A <B>Reaction Report</B>, available when modeling the fate of a reactive water quality constituent, graphically depicts the overall average reaction rates occurring throughout the network in the following locations</P>

<P>·the bulk flow</P>

<P>·the pipe wall</P>

<P>·within storage tanks.</P>

<P></P>

<P>A pie chart shows what percent of the overall reaction rate is occurring in each location. The chart legend displays the average rates in mass units per hour. A footnote on the chart shows the inflow rate of the reactant into the system.</P>

<P></P>

<P>The information in the Reaction Report can show at a glance what mechanism is responsible for the majority of growth or decay of a substance in the network. For example, if one observes that most of the chlorine decay in a system is occurring in the storage tanks and not at the walls of the pipes then one might infer that a corrective strategy of pipe cleaning and replacement will have little effect in improving chlorine residuals.</P>
