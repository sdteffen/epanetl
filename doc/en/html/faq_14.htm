<P>Save the network to file as ASCII text (select <B>File &gt;&gt; Export &gt;&gt; Network</B>). With EPANET still running, start up your text editor program. Load the saved network file into the editor. When you are done editing the file, save it to disk. Switch to EPANET and read in the file (select <B>File &gt;&gt; Open</B>). You can keep switching back and forth between the editor program and EPANET, as more changes are needed. Just remember to save the file after modifying it in the editor, and reopen it again after switching to EPANET. If you use a word processor (such as WordPad) or a spreadsheet as your editor, remember to save the file as plain ASCII text.</P>
