<P>Represent the well as a reservoir whose head equals the piezometric head of the groundwater aquifer. Then connect your pump from the reservoir to the rest of the network. You can add piping ahead of the pump to represent local losses around the pump.</P>

<P>If you know the rate at which the well is pumping then an alternate approach is to replace the well and pump combination with a junction assigned a negative demand equal to the pumping rate. A time pattern can also be assigned to the demand if the pumping rate varies over time.</P>
