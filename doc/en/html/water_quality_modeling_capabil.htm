<P>In addition to hydraulic modeling, EPANET provides the following water quality modeling capabilities:</P>

<P></P>

<P>·models the movement of a non-reactive tracer material through the network over time</P>

<P>·models the movement and fate of a reactive material as it grows (e.g., a disinfection by-product) or decays (chlorine residual) with time</P>

<P>·models the age of water throughout a network</P>

<P>·tracks the percent of flow from a given node reaching all other nodes over time</P>

<P>·models reactions both in the bulk flow and at the pipe wall</P>

<P>·uses n-th order kinetics to model reactions in the bulk flow</P>

<P>·uses zero or first order kinetics to model reactions at the pipe wall</P>

<P>·accounts for mass transfer limitations when modeling pipe wall reactions</P>

<P>·allows growth or decay reactions to proceed up to a limiting concentration</P>

<P>·employs global reaction rate coefficients that can be modified on a pipe-by-pipe basis</P>

<P>·allows wall reaction rate coefficients to be correlated to pipe roughness</P>

<P>·allows for time-varying concentration or mass inputs at any location in the network</P>

<P>·models storage tanks as being either complete mix, plug flow, or two-compartment reactors</P>

<P></P>

<P>By employing these features, EPANET can study such water quality phenomena as:</P>

<P></P>

<P>·Blending water from different sources</P>

<P>·Age of water throughout a system</P>

<P>·Loss of chlorine residuals</P>

<P>·Growth of disinfection by-products</P>

<P>·Contaminant propagation events</P>
