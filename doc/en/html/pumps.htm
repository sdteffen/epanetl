<P><B>Pumps</B> are devices that impart energy to a fluid thereby raising its hydraulic head.</P>

<P></P>

<P>톂he principal input parameter for a pump is its <A HREF="pump_curve.htm">pump curve</A> (the combination of heads and flows that the pump can produce). </P>

<P></P>

<P> In lieu of a pump curve, the pump could be represented as a <A HREF="constant_energy_pump.htm">constant energy device</A>.</P>

<P></P>

<P> The principal output parameters are flow and head gain.</P>

<P></P>

<P> Flow through a pump is unidirectional. If the system requires more head than the pump can produce, the pump is shut down. If it requires more flow, the pump curve is extrapolated to produce the flow even if a negative head results. In both cases a warning message is issued.</P>

<P></P>

<P> Pumps can be turned on and off at preset times, when tank levels fall below or above certain set-points, or when nodal pressures fall below or above certain set-points through the use of <A HREF="controls.htm">controls</A> and <A HREF="time_patterns.htm">time patterns</A>.</P>

<P></P>

<P> Variable speed pumps can also be considered by specifying that their speed setting be changed under these same types of conditions.  By definition, the original pump curve supplied to the program has a relative speed setting of 1. If the pump speed doubles, then the relative setting would be 2; if run at half speed, the relative setting is 0.5 and so on.</P>

<P></P>

<P> EPANET can also compute the energy consumption and cost of a pump. Either pump-specific <A HREF="efficiency_curve.htm">efficiency curves</A> and energy pricing parameters can be supplied or <A HREF="1n3ozj5.htm">global energy options</A> will be used.</P>
