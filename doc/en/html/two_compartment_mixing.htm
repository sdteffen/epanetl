<P>This mixing model divides the available storage volume in a tank into two compartments, both of which are assumed to be completely mixed. The inlet/outlet pipes of the tank are assumed to be located in the first compartment. New water that enters the tank mixes with the water in the first compartment. If this compartment is full, then it sends its overflow to the second compartment where it completely mixes with the water already stored there. When water leaves the tank, it exits from the first compartment, which if full, receives an equivalent amount of water from the second compartment to make up the difference. The first compartment is capable of simulating short circuiting between inflow and outflow while the second compartment can represent dead zones. The user must supply a single parameter which is the fraction of the total tank volume devoted to the first compartment.</P>
