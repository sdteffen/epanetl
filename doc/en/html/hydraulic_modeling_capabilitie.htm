<P>Full-featured and accurate hydraulic modeling is a prerequisite for doing effective water quality modeling. EPANET contains a state-of-the-art hydraulic analysis engine that includes the following capabilities: </P>

<P></P>

<P>·places no limit on the size of network that can be analyzed</P>

<P>·computes friction headloss using either Hazen-Williams, Darcy-Weisbach, or Chezy-Manning equations</P>

<P>·includes minor headlosses for bends, fittings, etc. </P>

<P>·models constant or variable speed pumps</P>

<P>·computes pumping energy and cost</P>

<P>·models various types of valves including shutoff, check, pressure regulating, and flow control valves</P>

<P>· allows storage tanks to have any shape (i.e., diameter can vary with height)</P>

<P>·considers multiple demand categories at nodes, each with its own pattern of time variation</P>

<P>·models pressure-dependent flow issuing from emitters (sprinkler heads)</P>

<P>·can base system operation on both simple tank level or timer controls and on complex rule-based controls</P>
