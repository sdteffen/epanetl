<P>EPANET performs extended period simulation of hydraulic and water quality behavior within pressurized pipe networks.  A network consists of pipes, nodes (pipe junctions), pumps, valves and storage tanks or reservoirs.  EPANET tracks the flow of water in each pipe, the pressure at each node, the height of water in each tank, and the concentration of a chemical species throughout the network during a simulation period comprised of multiple time steps.  In addition to chemical species, water age and source tracing can also be simulated. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Running under Windows, EPANET provides an integrated environment for editing network input data, running hydraulic and water quality simulations, and viewing the results in a variety of formats. These include color-coded network maps, data tables, time series graphs, and contour plots.</P>

<P>EPANET was developed by the Water Supply and Water Resources Division (formerly the Drinking Water Research Division) of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory.</P>
