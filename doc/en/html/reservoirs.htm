<P><B>Reservoirs</B> are nodes that represent an infinite external source or sink of water to the network. They are used to model such things as lakes, rivers, groundwater aquifers, and tie-ins to other systems. Reservoirs can also serve as water quality source points.</P>

<P></P>

<P>The primary input properties for a reservoir are its hydraulic head and initial water quality. Because a reservoir is a boundary point to a network, its head and water quality cannot be affected by what happens within the network. Therefore it has no computed output properties. However its head can be made to vary with time by assigning a <A HREF="time_patterns.htm">time pattern</A> to it.</P>
