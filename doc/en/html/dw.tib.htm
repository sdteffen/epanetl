<P>The decay of many substances, such as chlorine, can be modeled adequately as a simple first-order reaction. <I>Kb</I> is very dependent on the nature of the water being modeled and can range from below -0.01/day to greater than -1.0/day. It can be estimated by placing a sample of water in a series of non-reacting glass bottles and analyzing the contents of each bottle at different points in time.</P>

<P></P>

<P>If the reaction is first-order, then plotting the natural log (<I>Ct / Co</I>) against time shouls result in a straight line, where <I>Ct </I>is the concentration at time t and <I>Co</I> is the concentration at time zero. <I>Kb</I> would then be estimated as the slope of this line.</P>
