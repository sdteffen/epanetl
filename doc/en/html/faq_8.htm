<P>If the pressure variation in the tank is negligible, use a very short, very wide cylindrical tank whose elevation is set close to the pressure head rating of the tank. Select the tank dimensions so that changes in volume produce only very small changes in water surface elevation. If the pressure head developed in the tank ranges between H1 and H2, with corresponding volumes V1 and V2, then use a cylindrical tank whose cross-sectional area equals (V2-V1)/(H2-H1).</P>
