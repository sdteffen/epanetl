<P>The water quality module of EPANET can track the growth or decay of a substance by reaction as it travels through a distribution system. In order to do this it needs to know the rate at which the substance reacts and how this rate might depend on substance concentration.  Reactions can occur both within the bulk flow and with material along the pipe wall. Bulk fluid reactions can also occur within tanks. EPANET allows a modeler to use different reaction rates for the two zones of reaction.</P>
