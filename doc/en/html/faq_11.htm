<P>Bulk reaction coefficients can be estimated by performing a bottle test in the laboratory (see <A HREF="bulk_flow_reaction_rates.htm">Bulk Flow Reaction Rates</A>). Wall reaction rates cannot be measured directly. They must be back-fitted against calibration data collected from field studies (e.g., using trial and error to determine coefficient values that produce simulation results that best match field observations). Plastic pipe and relatively new lined iron pipe are not expected to exert any significant wall demand for disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramines.</P>
