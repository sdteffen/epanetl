<P>Source tracing tracks over time what percent of water reaching any node in the network had its origin at a particular node. The source node can be any node in the network, including storage nodes.  Source tracing is a useful tool for analyzing distribution systems drawing water from two or more different raw water supplies.  It can show to what degree water from a given source blends with that from other sources, and how the spatial pattern of this blending changes over time. EPANET provides an automatic facility for performing source tracing. The user need only specify which node is the source node. Internally, EPANET treats this node as a constant source of a non-reacting constituent that enters the network with a concentration of 100.</P>
