<P>Error 110 is issued if at some point in an analysis the set of equations that model flow and energy balance in the network cannot be solved. This can occur when some portion of a system demands water but has no links physically connecting it to any source of water. In such a case EPANET will also issue warning messages about nodes being disconnected. The equations might also be unsolvable if unrealistic numbers were used for certain network properties.</P>
