<P>Place the booster station at a junction node with zero or positive demand or at a tank. Select the node into the <A HREF="property_editor.htm">Property Editor</A> and click the ellipsis button in the Source Quality field to launch the <A HREF="source_quality_editor.htm">Source Quality Editor</A>. In the editor, set Source Type to <B>SETPOINT</B> <B>BOOSTER</B> and set Source Quality to the chlorine concentration that water leaving the node will be boosted to. Alternatively, if the booster station will use flow-paced addition of chlorine then set Source Type to <B>FLOW PACED BOOSTER</B> and Source Quality to the concentration that will be added to the concentration leaving the node. Specify a time pattern ID in the Time Pattern field if you wish to vary the boosting level with time.</P>
