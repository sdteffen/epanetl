<P>The <B>Statistics</B> page of a Calibration Report lists various error statistics between simulated and observed values at each measurement location and for the network as a whole. If a measured value at a location was taken at a time in-between the simulation's reporting time intervals then a simulated value for that time is found by interpolating between the simulated values at either end of the interval.</P>

<P></P>

<P>The statistics listed for each measurement location are:</P>

<P>· Number of observations</P>

<P>·Mean of the observed values</P>

<P>·Mean of the simulated values</P>

<P>·Mean absolute error between each observed and simulated value</P>

<P>·Root mean square error (square root of the mean of the squared errors between the observed and simulated values)</P>

<P></P>

<P>These statistics are also provided for the network as a whole (i.e., all measurements and model errors pooled together). Also listed is the correlation between means (correlation coefficient between the mean observed value and mean simulated value at each location).</P>
