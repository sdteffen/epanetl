<P>EPANET's water quality simulator uses a Lagrangian time-based approach to track the fate of discrete parcels of water as they move along pipes and mix together at junctions between fixed-length time steps. These water quality time steps are typically much shorter than the hydraulic time step (e.g., minutes rather than hours) to accommodate the short times of travel that can occur within pipes. However, as with hydraulics, results are only reported at the end of each user-specified reporting time step.</P>
