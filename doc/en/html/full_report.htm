<P>When the <IMG SRC="../images/bm27.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> icon appears in the Run Status section of the <A HREF="status_bar.htm">Status Bar</A>, a report of computed results for all nodes, links and time periods can be saved to file by selecting <B>Full</B> from the <B>Report</B> menu. This report, which can be viewed or printed outside of EPANET using any text editor or word processor, contains the following information:</P>

<P></P>

<P>·project title and notes</P>

<P>·a table listing the end nodes, length, and diameter of each link</P>

<P>·a table listing energy usage statistics for each pump</P>

<P>·a pair of tables for each time period listing computed values for each node (demand, head, pressure, and quality) and for each link (flow, velocity, headloss, and status).</P>

<P></P>

<P>This feature is useful mainly for documenting the final results of a network analysis on small to moderately sized networks (full report files for large networks analyzed over many time periods can easily consume dozens of megabytes of disk space). Other reporting tools are available for viewing computed results on a more selective basis. </P>
