<P>EPANET will issue a warning message when it encounters negative pressures at junctions that have positive demands. This usually indicates that there is some problem with the way the network has been designed or operated. Negative pressures can occur when portions of the network can only receive water through links that have been closed off. In such cases an additional warning message about the network being disconnected is also issued.</P>
