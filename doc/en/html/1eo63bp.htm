<P>A Pressure Sustaining Valve (PSV) is used to maintain a set pressure at a specific point in the pipe network. The valve can be in one of three states:</P>

<P></P>

<P>·partially opened (i.e., active) to maintain its pressure setting on its upstream side when the downstream pressure is below this value</P>

<P></P>

<P>·fully open if the downstream pressure is above the setting</P>

<P></P>

<P>·closed if the pressure on the downstream side exceeds that on the upstream side (i.e., reverse flow is not allowed).</P>
