<P>Water quality sources are nodes where the quality of external flow entering the network is specified. They can represent the main treatment works, a well-head or satellite treatment facility, or an unwanted contaminant intrusion. Source quality can be made to vary over time by assigning it a time pattern. EPANET can model the following types of sources:</P>

<P>유 <B>concentration source</B> fixes the concentration of any external inflow entering the network at a node, such as flow from a reservoir or from a negative demand placed at a junction.</P>

<P>유 <B>mass</B> <B>booster</B> source adds a fixed mass flow to that entering the node from other points in the network.</P>

<P>유 <B>flow paced booster</B> source adds a fixed concentration to that resulting from the mixing of all inflow to the node from other points in the network</P>

<P>유 <B>setpoint booster</B> source fixes the concentration of any flow leaving the node (as long as the concentration resulting from all inflow to the node is below the setpoint).</P>

<P></P>

<P>The concentration-type source is best used for nodes that represent source water supplies or treatment works (e.g., reservoirs or nodes assigned a negative demand). The booster-type source is best used to model direct injection of a tracer or additional disinfectant into the network or to model a contaminant intrusion.</P>
