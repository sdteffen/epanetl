<P>Minor headlosses (also called local losses) can be associated with the added turbulence that occurs at bends, junctions, meters, and valves. The importance of such losses will depend on the layout of the pipe network and the degree of accuracy required.  Minor losses are proportional to the velocity head of water flowing through a pipe or valve (V²/2g). The proportionality constant is termed the "<A HREF="minor_loss_coefficients.htm">loss coefficient</A>" and its value depends on the geometry and type of fitting. </P>
