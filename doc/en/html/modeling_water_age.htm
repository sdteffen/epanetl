<P>Water age is the time spent by a parcel of water in the network. It provides a simple, non-specific measure of the overall quality of delivered drinking water. New water entering the network from reservoirs or source nodes enters with age of zero. As this water moves through the pipe network it splits apart and blends together with parcels of varying age at pipe junctions and storage facilities. EPANET provides automatic modeling of water age. Internally, it treats age as a reactive constituent whose growth follows zero-order kinetics with a rate constant equal to 1 (i.e., each second the water becomes a second older).</P>
