<P>Use a General Purpose Valve with a headloss curve that shows increasing headloss with decreasing flow. Information from the valve manufacturer should provide help in constructing the curve. Place a check valve (i.e., a short length of pipe whose status is set to CV) in series with the valve to restrict the direction of flow.</P>
