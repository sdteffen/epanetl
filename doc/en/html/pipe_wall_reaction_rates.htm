<P>In addition to bulk flow reactions, EPANET can model reactions that occur with material on or near the pipe wall. The rate of this reaction can be considered to be dependent on the concentration in the bulk flow by using an expression of the form</P>

<P></P>

<P><IMG SRC="../images/bm58.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0></P>

<P>where Kw = a wall reaction rate coefficient and (A / V) = the surface area per unit volume within a pipe (equal to 4 divided by the diameter). The latter term converts the mass reacting per unit of wall area to a per unit volume basis. EPANET limits the wall reaction order (n) to either 0 or 1, so that the units of Kw are either mass/area/time or length/time, respectively.</P>

<P></P>

<P>The parameter Kw appearing in the above rate expression should be adjusted to account for any mass transfer limitations in moving reactants and products between the bulk flow and the wall. EPANET does this automatically, basing the adjustment on the molecular diffusivity of the substance being modeled and on the flow's Reynolds number. (Setting the molecular diffusivity to zero will cause mass transfer effects to be ignored.)</P>

<P></P>

<P>The wall rate coefficient can depend on temperature and can also be correlated to pipe age and material. See <A HREF="2ovdbva.htm">Wall Reaction - Pipe Roughness Correlation</A>.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Note:</B> EPANET requires that water be flowing in a pipe for a wall reaction to occur. Pipes with no flow have no computed wall reaction.</P>
