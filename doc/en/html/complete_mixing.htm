<P>This mixing  model assumes that all water that enters a tank is instantaneously and completely mixed with the water already in the tank. It is the simplest form of mixing behavior to assume, requires no extra parameters to describe it, and seems to apply quite well to a large number of facilities that operate in fill-and-draw fashion.</P>
