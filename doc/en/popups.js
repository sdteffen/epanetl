udy3d3 = "Disconnected Network\nEPANET classifies a network as being disconnected if there is no way to provide water to all nodes that have demands. This can occur if there is no path of open links between a junction with demand and either a reservoir, a tank, or a junction with a negative demand. If the problem is caused by a closed link EPANET will still compute a hydraulic solution (probably with extremely large negative pressures) and attempt to identify the problem link in its Status Report. If no connecting link(s) exist EPANET will be unable to solve the hydraulic equations for flows and pressures and will return an Error 110 message when an analysis is made. Under an extended period simulation it is possible for nodes to become disconnected as links change status over time."
faq_4 = "Replace the pump with a Pressure Breaker Valve oriented in the opposite direction. Convert the design head to an equivalent pressure and use this as the setting for the valve. After running the analysis the flow through the valve becomes the pump\'s design flow."
faq_1 = "See Importing a Partial Network."
faq_10 = "If simulating existing conditions monitored as part of a calibration study, assign measured values to the nodes where measurements were made and interpolate (by eye) to assign values to other locations. It is highly recommended that storage tanks and source locations be included in the set of locations where measurements are made.\n\nTo simulate future conditions start with arbitrary initial values (except at the tanks) and run the analysis for a number of repeating demand pattern cycles so that the water quality results begin to repeat in a periodic fashion as well. The number of such cycles can be reduced if good initial estimates are made for the water quality in the tanks. For example, if modeling water age the initial value could be set to the tank\'s average residence time which is approximately equal to the fraction of its volume it exchanges each day."
faq_11 = "Bulk reaction coefficients can be estimated by performing a bottle test in the laboratory (see Bulk Flow Reaction Rates). Wall reaction rates cannot be measured directly. They must be back-fitted against calibration data collected from field studies (e.g., using trial and error to determine coefficient values that produce simulation results that best match field observations). Plastic pipe and relatively new lined iron pipe are not expected to exert any significant wall demand for disinfectants such as chlorine and chloramines."
faq_12 = "Place the booster station at a junction node with zero or positive demand or at a tank. Select the node into the Property Editor and click the ellipsis button in the Source Quality field to launch the Source Quality Editor. In the editor, set Source Type to SETPOINT BOOSTER and set Source Quality to the chlorine concentration that water leaving the node will be boosted to. Alternatively, if the booster station will use flow-paced addition of chlorine then set Source Type to FLOW PACED BOOSTER and Source Quality to the concentration that will be added to the concentration leaving the node. Specify a time pattern ID in the Time Pattern field if you wish to vary the boosting level with time."
faq_13 = "THM growth can be modeled using first-order saturation kinetics. Select Options - Reactions from the Data Browser. Set the bulk reaction order to 1 and the limiting concentration to the maximum THM level that the water can produce, given a long enough holding time. Set the bulk reaction coefficient to a positive number reflective of the rate of THM production (e.g., 0.7 divided by the THM doubling time). Estimates of the reaction coefficient and the limiting concentration can be obtained from laboratory testing. The reaction coefficient will increase with increasing water temperature. Initial concentrations at all network nodes should at least equal the THM concentration entering the network from its source node."
faq_14 = "Save the network to file as ASCII text (select File >> Export >> Network). With EPANET still running, start up your text editor program. Load the saved network file into the editor. When you are done editing the file, save it to disk. Switch to EPANET and read in the file (select File >> Open). You can keep switching back and forth between the editor program and EPANET, as more changes are needed. Just remember to save the file after modifying it in the editor, and reopen it again after switching to EPANET. If you use a word processor (such as WordPad) or a spreadsheet as your editor, remember to save the file as plain ASCII text."
faq_15 = "Yes. This could prove useful in making side-by-side comparisons of two or more different design or operating scenarios."
faq_2 = "Represent the well as a reservoir whose head equals the piezometric head of the groundwater aquifer. Then connect your pump from the reservoir to the rest of the network. You can add piping ahead of the pump to represent local losses around the pump.\nIf you know the rate at which the well is pumping then an alternate approach is to replace the well and pump combination with a junction assigned a negative demand equal to the pumping rate. A time pattern can also be assigned to the demand if the pumping rate varies over time."
faq_3 = "Set the status of the pump to CLOSED. At the suction (inlet) node add a demand equal to the required pump flow and place a negative demand of the same magnitude at the discharge node. After analyzing the network, the difference in heads between the two nodes is what the pump needs to deliver."
faq_5 = "Replace the reservoirs with junctions that have negative demands equal to the schedule of source flows. (Make sure there is at least one tank or remaining reservoir in the network, otherwise EPANET will issue an error message.)"
faq_6 = "To determine the maximum pressure available at a node when the flow demanded must be increased to suppress a fire, add the fire flow to the node\'s normal demand, run the analysis, and note the resulting pressure at the node.\n\nTo determine the maximum flow available at a particular pressure, set the emitter coefficient at the node to a large value (e.g., 100 times the maximum flow expected) and add the required pressure head (2.3 times the pressure in psi) to the node\'s elevation.  After running the analysis, the available fire flow equals the actual demand reported for the node minus any consumer demand that was assigned to it."
faq_7 = "Use a General Purpose Valve with a headloss curve that shows increasing headloss with decreasing flow. Information from the valve manufacturer should provide help in constructing the curve. Place a check valve (i.e., a short length of pipe whose status is set to CV) in series with the valve to restrict the direction of flow."
faq_8 = "If the pressure variation in the tank is negligible, use a very short, very wide cylindrical tank whose elevation is set close to the pressure head rating of the tank. Select the tank dimensions so that changes in volume produce only very small changes in water surface elevation. If the pressure head developed in the tank ranges between H1 and H2, with corresponding volumes V1 and V2, then use a cylindrical tank whose cross-sectional area equals (V2-V1)/(H2-H1)."
faq_9 = "Use the following configuration:\n (*) \nThe tank\'s inlet consists of a Pressure Sustaining Valve followed by a short length of large diameter pipe. The pressure setting of the PSV should be 0, and the elevation of its end nodes should equal the elevation at which the true pipe connects to the tank. Use a Check Valve on the tank\'s outlet line to prevent reverse flow through it."

1fiwnw5 = "Hydraulic Equations Unsolvable\nError 110 is issued if at some point in an analysis the set of equations that model flow and energy balance in the network cannot be solved. This can occur when some portion of a system demands water but has no links physically connecting it to any source of water. In such a case EPANET will also issue warning messages about nodes being disconnected. The equations might also be unsolvable if unrealistic numbers were used for certain network properties."
17h533i = "Negative Pressures\nEPANET will issue a warning message when it encounters negative pressures at junctions that have positive demands. This usually indicates that there is some problem with the way the network has been designed or operated. Negative pressures can occur when portions of the network can only receive water through links that have been closed off. In such cases an additional warning message about the network being disconnected is also issued."
1eo63bp = "Pressure Sustaining Valve\nA Pressure Sustaining Valve (PSV) is used to maintain a set pressure at a specific point in the pipe network. The valve can be in one of three states:\n\n·partially opened (i.e., active) to maintain its pressure setting on its upstream side when the downstream pressure is below this value\n\n·fully open if the downstream pressure is above the setting\n\n·closed if the pressure on the downstream side exceeds that on the upstream side (i.e., reverse flow is not allowed)."
