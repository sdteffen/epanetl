<P>Having completed the initial design of our network it is a good idea to save our work to a file at this point.</P>

<P>1.From the <B>File</B> menu select the <B>Save As</B> option.</P>

<P>2.In the Save As dialog that appears, select a folder and file name under which to save this project. We suggest naming the file tutorial.net. (An extension of .net will be added to the file name if one is not supplied.)</P>

<P>3.Click <B>OK</B> to save the project to file.</P>

<P>The project data is saved to the file in a special binary format. If you wanted to save the network data to file as readable text, use the <B>File | Export | Network</B> command instead.</P>

<P>To open our project at some later time, we would select the <B>Open</B> command from the <B>File</B> menu.</P>
