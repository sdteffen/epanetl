<P>Next we show how to extend the analysis of our example network to include water quality. The simplest case would be tracking the growth in water age throughout the network over time. To make this analysis:</P>

<P>1.Select <B>Options - Quality</B> from the Data Browser.</P>

<P>2.Click the Browser's <B>Edit</B> button <IMG SRC="../images/bm19.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0> to make the Property Editor appear.</P>

<P>3.Select Age for the Parameter property in the Editor.</P>

<P>Run the analysis and select Age as the variable to view on the map. Create a time series plot for Age in the tank. Note that unlike water level, 72 hours is not enough time for the tank to reach periodic behavior for water age. (The default initial condition is to start all nodes with an age of 0.)</P>

<P>Try repeating the simulation using a 240-hour duration or assigning an initial age of 60 hours to the tank (enter 60 as the value of Initial Quality in the Property Editor for the tank).</P>
